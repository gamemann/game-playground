## Renders the sandbox in first person and in third, so a person can look at both.
##
## [b]A camera is the one thing in this repository no assertion reaches.[/b] Every check
## on the view switch is a check on an id — `active_id()`answers "tp" — and an id is equally
## happy when the rig is inside the player's head, behind a wall, or looking at the sky.
## Four of the bugs in this family's list were found by looking at a frame.
##
## The last two frames put the HUD over first person, with the map's time left as a
## server's vote would describe it: `hud_clock` after an extend, `hud_no_clock` under the
## deployed `trigger: rtv_only` with no limit, where the slot must be gone rather than
## showing the local session's thirty minutes.
##
## The last three are an administrator's marks, from first person through the real HUD:
## `admin_beacon` a beaconed player on open floor ahead, `admin_beacon_wall` the same
## player behind a wall with only the through-walls column showing, and `admin_blind` the
## local player blinded, where the world must be gone to the edges and the HUD still on top.
##
## [codeblock]
## tools/screenshot_views.sh
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]Not `--headless`[/b]: that gives a null renderer and every frame it saves is empty,
## which is worse than no screenshot because it looks like one.
