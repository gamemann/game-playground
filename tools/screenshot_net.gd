## Renders a CONNECTED client looking at another player, and measures how smoothly that
## player moves on screen. The view `tools/screenshot_views.sh` cannot give: offline there is
## nobody else, and the bugs this exists for were all in what a client draws of a player it
## is only told about.
##
## [codeblock]
## tools/screenshot_net.sh                # four consecutive frames, screenshots/net_0..3.png
## tools/screenshot_net.sh --no-interp    # the same with the client's interpolation off
## tools/screenshot_net.sh --walk         # THIS client strafes its own player: is it predicted?
## [/codeblock]
##
## A server and a client in one process, joined by the loopback `headless_net` uses: the
## server's world is in a SubViewport with its own physics space that is never drawn, and
## the client's is the one on screen. Every frame calls `PlaygroundClient.present_frame`,
## the function the real client's `_process` calls.
##
## [b]The probe.[/b] Once a rendered frame, the other player's drawn position is divided by
## that frame's delta: the apparent speed. Running flat out in a straight line it should be
## the same every frame, and the share of frames far from the typical one is the judder.
## `--no-interp` shows what that share is when it is wrong, because a number with nothing
## to compare it to proves nothing.
##
## [b]`--walk` is the other probe: this client's OWN player.[/b] It stands for three quarters
## of a second, strafes east for 90 ticks, stands, strafes back, through the same `client_tick` the
## real client calls, and reports what a player feels: how many ticks after a key is pressed
## the player's node moves (0 is the tick it was pressed in), the predictor's corrections,
## and the eye's apparent speed per rendered frame while the server has them at full speed.
## Until 2026-09-25 the client predicted nobody — every mirror was owner 0 — and this is where
## that shows as a number: 3 ticks from key to motion, and an eye that moved only on the
## frames a snapshot landed. Snapshots at 32 a second in this mode, as `PlaygroundClient`
## asks for; the remote-player probe keeps the 20 its figures were taken at.
##
## xvfb-run, never --headless: headless gives a null renderer and saves a frame of nothing.
