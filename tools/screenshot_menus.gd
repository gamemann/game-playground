## Renders this game's own screens to `screenshots/` so a person can look at them.
##
## Separate from `screenshot.gd`, which renders MAPS. The spawn menu is the screen worth
## the most here: it is this project's own, it is the one a player is in most often, and
## two of the interface bugs in this game's history were in it — a `TabBar` that hid two of
## its three tabs behind scroll arrows, and an NPC silhouette that came out as a coloured
## bar. Neither was reachable from an assertion; both were found by looking.
##
## [b]Not `--headless`[/b]: that gives a null renderer, a 64 x 64 viewport, and frames that
## are empty for a reason that has nothing to do with the code.
