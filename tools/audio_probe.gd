## Asks whether this game actually makes a noise, on a machine that has a sound card.
##
## [b]This exists because every assertion about this game's audio passed while the game was
## silent.[/b] The catalogue was complete and argued over, and every path in it named an
## `.ogg` nobody had produced. `examples/headless_presentation.tscn` checks the catalogue
## and the limits, and it cannot check any of this: a headless run has no audio device, so
## [DotAudioManager] correctly builds a [DotAudioSinkNull] and the one question worth
## asking here never comes up.
##
## So this is the audio half of what `tools/screenshot*.sh` is for the interface — the only
## thing here that can tell "the game would make a noise" apart from "the game has a table
## of sounds".
##
## [b]It asks `is_playing`, not "did I get a handle".[/b] A handle says the pool had room;
## only [method DotAudioSink.is_playing] says a speaker is moving. The first version of
## this probe, in game-arena, reported four sounds on a run in which the engine refused
## playback four times — a probe that can be satisfied by the bug it is looking for.
##
## Run through `tools/audio_probe.sh`. [b]Not `--headless`[/b]: `AudioServer` reports
## `Dummy` there, and the driver name is the only honest question to ask about audio.

## One of each kind this game makes.
const PROBES: Array[StringName] = [&"prop_spawn", &"prop_land", &"buy", &"refused"]

## Frames to let the tree come up before asking anything. An [AudioStreamPlayer] parented
## before the root viewport is live is not inside the tree and refuses to play.
