## What a prop, an NPC or anything else with rigid-body physics replicates: where it is
## and how it is turned.
##
## [b]Server-authoritative and never predicted, and that is a decision rather than an
## omission.[/b] Godot's rigid-body solver is not reproducible across machines — island
## ordering, sleep thresholds and contact caching all differ — so a client that
## predicted a stack of barrels would disagree with the server within a second and be
## corrected continuously. That is why the whole sandbox is built around the client
## sending INTENT (spawn this, grab that) and the server owning the answer.
##
## The consequence a player feels is one round trip between clicking the physics gun and
## the prop moving, and it is the correct trade: a wrong-but-immediate barrel that snaps
## back is worse than a right one that starts a moment later.
##
## [member net_position] and [member net_rotation] are interpolated. Nothing else is
## replicated per tick: a client draws a prop, it does not simulate one.

## changes how the prop is drawn, and because a frozen prop stops sending changes and a
## client otherwise cannot tell "frozen" from "the packets stopped".

## the other prop's net id. Fields rather than an array because a replicated field is a
## property; slot 0 keeps the names the single rope had. The physics of every rope is the
## server's either way.
