## Chat, moderation and voice, wired to this sandbox's people and this game's wire.
##
## [b]The same three addons the other games join, and the third set of proximity
## answers.[/b] game-hungario is an arena, so its voice is proximity. A sandbox is a room
## and an arena at once —
## people build together in one corner and run the course in another — so **text has a
## near channel and voice is the whole server**, which is the arrangement every sandbox
## server has ever shipped with, and for the reason they all found: a builder shouting for
## a hand should be heard, and somebody in the corner reading should be able to stop
## reading the shouting.
##
## [b]The sequence is [DotGameServices]'s.[/b] Moderation first, because it publishes the
## mute source both routers look up when they start; then chat, the website relay, voice.
## This was 557 lines of its own until 2026-09-27; what is left is what is this game's:
##
## - the channels, the rules and the voice format, as statics a CLIENT reads too;
## - where a person is standing, off the controller's state rather than the node;
## - **the bridge is who is in the game**, not dot-server's session list. A peer is only
##   sent a line once it has said it can receive ([method _chat_peers]), a line is
##   attributed to the bridge's player id ([method _key_of]), and a punishment falls back
##   to a `local:` subject when there is no session — which is what lets `headless_net`
##   run the real sequence with no [DotServer] at all;
## - the one meta field this wire carries, `x.p`, stamped on every line
##   ([method _send_chat]);
## - [b]the backlog is the module's[/b] ([method _peer_can_receive] answers false): it is
##   sent from `PlaygroundModule._welcome` once the peer is ready, never at seating;
## - [b]the live tools are the module's too[/b] ([member DotGameServices.mod_tools_enabled]
##   is off): `PlaygroundModTools` needs the arena's health, which is built after this,
##   and the module clears their return history on every map change. A second set built
##   here would bind the same command names to the same console.
##
## [b]dot-server's own chat is cancelled, not run beside this.[/b] [DotChatRouter] has the
## rules now, and [PlaygroundModule] cancels `player_chat` so there is exactly one path.
## Two would be two sets of rules to keep in step, and the one that skipped the filter
## would be the one that leaked admin chat.

# No `const CHANNEL` and no `RELAY_CONFIG_PATH`: [DotGameServices] declares both, and
# GDScript refuses a redeclaration. The relay reads `user://chat_relay.json` as it did.
