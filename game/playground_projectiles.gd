## Grenades and rockets in flight in the sandbox, and what happens where they go off.
##
## [b]This exists because the game used to drop them.[/b] A zee weapon's outcome carries
## its shots and its [DotWeaponSpawn]s. The game resolved the shots and ignored the spawns,
## so a thrown frag left the hand, cost a grenade and never existed. dot-weapon returns a
## spawn because a projectile is an entity with a lifetime, and something has to fly it.
## game-arena's `arena_projectiles.gd` is the same job against that game's analytic map.
## This one is written separately, as the family's rule says, because the sandbox's world
## is Godot physics: crates, welds and whatever somebody built. A grenade has to bounce off
## those as well as the floor.
##
## [b]It flies on the simulation tick, swept with a ray each tick.[/b] A rocket at 40 m/s
## moves 31 cm a tick at 128 Hz, and a plank is thinner than that. A point test would let
## it through about one time in three.
##
## [b]Only the authority decides anything.[/b] The server (or an offline game) detonates,
## hurts and shoves. A connected client is told about each launch and flies its own copy so
## it can draw the arc, and its copy never goes off on its own: the client's physics world
## holds interpolated mirrors of the props, which are not where the server's are, so a
## client deciding its own detonation would put the blast somewhere the server did not.
## It goes off when the server's DETONATE says where.
##
## [b]NPCs flee it while it is live.[/b] Every few ticks each projectile is a DANGER on
## every sound board it was given, reaching as far as its splash plus a margin. That is
## what dot-npc-ai's `flee_danger` acts on: soldiers and wave NPCs get out from under a
## grenade, and they hear the bang as a COMBAT sound.

## One projectile, mid-air, rolling, or stuck to something.
