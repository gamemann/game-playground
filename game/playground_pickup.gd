## Picking players up with the physics gun, and who may not be.
##
## [b]A held player is a rider whose vehicle is a beam.[/b] Everything a vehicle seat
## already turns off is what holding somebody has to turn off: their own movement (two
## authorities over one position shake), their client's prediction of it (a predicted
## controller fights every snapshot), and the timer (being carried down a course is not a
## run). So a hold sets [member PlaygroundPlayer.riding] with no vehicle, and every reader
## of that flag — the predictor, the camera blend, the mod tools' teleport — already does
## the right thing. On the wire it is a SEAT with vehicle 0, which is also what an older
## client understands: it stops predicting and adopts the server's position.
##
## [b]Moved by sweeping the body, not by writing the position.[/b] A held player carried
## into a wall is stopped by it, as a held crate is; written straight into the state they
## would be put inside the wall and the motor would spend the next tick pushing them out.
##
## [b]Immunity is by role, and an override role beats it.[/b] `pg_pickup_immune "admin"`
## keeps the admins on their feet; `pg_pickup_override "root"` lets the owner pick up
## anybody. Roles are [PlaygroundLimits]' answer — admin groups by name, `admin`, `root` —
## so a server with an admin file already has them. Letting go keeps the beam's velocity:
## a throw.
