extends RigidBody3D

## One spawnable thing, built from its [DotPropDef] rather than from a saved scene.
##
## [b]One scene for the whole catalogue, because this project ships no art.[/b] A
## sandbox needs a menu with enough in it to build something — planks, panels,
## barrels, balls of four sizes — and the honest way to get that is a modelled prop
## per entry. There are none here, so the shape, the extent and the colour are three
## fields of [member DotPropDef.meta] and this builds the body from them. A server
## with real content points [member DotPropDef.scene_path] at its own scenes and
## never loads this at all, which is the seam the catalogue was designed around:
## [DotPropDef] is checkable without loading anything, and the scene is fetched only
## when something is actually created.
##
## [codeblock]
## "meta": { "shape": "cylinder", "extent": [0.5, 1.4, 0.5], "colour": "6a6f78" }
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]The body is built by [method configure], not by [method Node._ready].[/b]
## [DotPropSpawner] instantiates the scene, places it, adds it to the world and
## [i]then[/i] emits `spawned` — so the definition is not available until after the
## node is in the tree, and a `_ready` that built a default box would build one that
## is immediately thrown away. Configuring instead of rebuilding also means the
## collision shape is only ever created once.

## Extent used when a definition says nothing. A one-metre crate.

	BOX,
	SPHERE,

## The definition this was built from. Kept so a tool or a HUD can name the prop
## without going back to the catalogue.
var def: DotPropDef = null

## How much bigger or smaller than its definition this prop is. 1 is as catalogued.
##
## [b]Rebuilt, never `scale`d.[/b] A scaled RigidBody3D is something Godot's physics does
## not support — the shape's size and the solver's idea of it disagree, contacts jitter and
## the body sinks into the floor — so a resize builds a new collision shape and mesh at the
## new extent, from the definition, every time. From the definition rather than from the
## current shape, so inflating and deflating back is exactly where it started.

## A colour the tool gun painted, or none (alpha 0). Over the definition's colour, not
## instead of it, so taking the paint off brings the catalogue's back.
var tint: Color = Color(0, 0, 0, 0)

## The ropes drawn from this prop, up to [constant ROPE_SLOTS]: each `{id: int (the
## constraint's), peer: Node3D or null, a: Vector3 (local), b: Vector3 (peer-local, or a
## world point with no peer), length: float}`. Written by [PlaygroundConstraints], read by
## the prop's net behaviour to tell clients.
var ropes: Array = []

## How many ropes one prop tells clients about. A rope is described on whichever of its two
## props has room, so a hub with three balloons tied to it uses none of the hub's slots
## (each balloon carries its own string), and three is room for a crate slung between
## anchors as well. More ropes than that on both ends are still simulated, and not drawn.

## Times the definition's mass, on top of the size: the physical-properties tool's weight.
var mass_multiplier: float = 1.0

## The smallest and largest a prop may be resized to.
