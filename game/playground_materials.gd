## What a map box can be made of, and what that means here: how it looks, how props slide
## and bounce on it, how a player moves on it, and whether it is a liquid you are IN.
##
## [b]The numbers are dot-physics' standard table, read once.[/b] Friction, bounce and
## density go to the solver from `DotPhysicsSurface`; the player's movement comes from the
## same entry through dot-player-controller's `DotFpsSurface.from_physics`, so ice is one
## number for a crate and for a person. The only thing this file adds is the LOOK, which is
## this game's (unshaded boxes on a grid).
##
## [b]A player's surface is found from the box's metadata[/b] (`dot_fps_surface`), which a
## client and a server both build from the same map document: a surface resolved any other
## way is one the prediction and the server disagree about.

# No CHANNEL: nothing here logs. A map that names an unknown material is refused by the
# document's validation, which says so.
