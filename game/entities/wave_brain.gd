## What a director-released NPC does: come at the players, and back off when it loses them.
##
## [b]Extended by PATH, like every brain.[/b] A brain is named by
## [member DotNpcDef.brain_script_path] and a mounted dot-cloud pack's `class_name` globals
## are not registered in the host — so a brain that named a class could only ever ship
## inside a build.
##
## [b]A tree here, and a machine in `npc_hunter.gd`, and the difference is the point.[/b]
## dot-npc-ai ships both and says which is which: a machine holds what an NPC *is* and a
## tree decides what it *does* within that. A wave NPC has one job — reach the players —
## and what varies is which of three ways it is currently doing it, in priority order. That
## is a selector, and writing it as a machine would be three states whose transitions are
## all "if the higher-priority one is unavailable".
##
## The trap this file exists to stay out of: **a guard behind a plain sequence is asked
## exactly once.** The sequence resumes at the running action and never re-checks the
## condition, so an NPC chases a target it no longer has. `reactive_with` is the idiom and
## it is used here for exactly that reason.

## How fast, in metres a second. From the definition, so a catalogue tunes it.
