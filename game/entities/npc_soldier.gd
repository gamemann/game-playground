## An NPC that carries a weapon and fights with it: dot-npc-ai's tactical brain on a body,
## with a real zee weapon in its hands.
##
## [b]The weapon is a zee rig, the same one a player holds.[/b] Fire rate, magazine,
## reload, spread and damage are the weapon's, not this file's, so an NPC with a shotgun is
## dangerous close and useless far for the same reason a player with one is. The brain
## decides when to pull the trigger — every gate a person has, see `ready_to_fire` — and
## this body holds it down for the rig. Ammunition is topped up from an endless reserve,
## because an NPC that ran dry and stood there would read as broken, not as out of ammo.
##
## [b]Hostile or friendly is a faction, nothing more.[/b] A soldier is on `hostile` and
## fights players and rebels; a rebel is on `player`, so the senses never pick a player and
## it fights soldiers instead, and follows whoever spawned it. Same file, two catalogue rows.
##
## [b]It dies.[/b] Health from the catalogue; shots from players and from other NPCs land
## through [method take_damage]; at zero it drops its weapon as a pickup and is removed.
