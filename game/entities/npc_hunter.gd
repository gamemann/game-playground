## A chaser with a **decision** rather than an `if`: dot-npc-ai's state machine and
## characteristics table, on top of dot-npc's senses.
##
## [b]`npc_chaser.gd` is still here and is still correct, and this is not a replacement for
## it.[/b] That one is thirty lines and does one thing; this one is what the same NPC looks
## like when a game wants it to be an opponent rather than a hazard. Both are in the
## catalogue, because a sandbox wants the cheap one for filling a room with and the
## expensive one for the arena — and because keeping both is the only honest way to say
## what the addon actually bought.
##
## What it buys, concretely:
##
## - **A reaction time.** `DotNpcAiCharacter` is the arena shooters' characteristics
##   table, and
##   `has_reacted()` is the gate every "act on what you see" branch belongs behind. An NPC
##   that turns and commits on the tick it first perceives somebody is one no player can
##   ever surprise, and that is the difference between a bot and a target.
## - **A character per NPC, which the server moves rather than replaces.** Each one gets its
##   own seed from its instance id, so twenty of them do not all react at the same moment —
##   which reads as a firing squad and is the bug the seeding exists to prevent. `npc_skill`
##   and `npc_reaction_scale` ([member Playground.npc_skill]) shift it live.
## - **Separation.** Twelve of these converging on one player climb each other, and the one
##   on top has a horizontal offset of nothing from the one below: it chases perfectly at a
##   dead stop with every number about it correct. `steer_with_spacing` is the fix and
##   dot-npc-ai found it the hard way.
## - **A machine rather than a tree**, because there are four states and the transitions
##   between them are the whole design. A tree here would be four leaves under a selector
##   pretending to be a hierarchy.
##
## [b]`extends` a PATH, not a class.[/b] A brain is named by path in the catalogue and a
## mounted dot-cloud pack's `class_name` globals are not registered in the host, so an
## entity that named a class could only ever ship inside a build.
