## NPCs the **server** releases, paced by dot-npc-ai-director.
##
## [b]This is a second population beside the entities, and the split is deliberate.[/b]
## This game's own note says an entity is a `DotPropInstance` first — it counts against a
## prop budget, it is on the undo stack, it goes when its owner leaves, and a physics gun
## can pick it up — because *an NPC you cannot pick up is the first thing a sandbox player
## will try*. That argument is about NPCs a **player** put there.
##
## A wave is not one. It is the server's, nobody spawned it, nobody owns it, and it is
## reclaimed when the players walk away from it — which is exactly the population
## [DotNpcSpawner] and [DotNpcDirector] are for, and none of which a prop budget can
## express. So there are two, with two different owners and two different reasons, and
## `pg_waves 1` is the only thing that makes the second exist at all.
##
## **Off by default**, like the arena. A sandbox where things come at you while you are
## building is a different server, and turning one into the other silently because an addon
## was installed is what a cvar exists to prevent.

## The body a wave NPC is.
##
## [b]`playground_`-prefixed, and that is a deployment constraint rather than a style.[/b]
## dot-server-deploy flattens every built-in game into one `game/` directory — a
## `.tscn` names its scripts by absolute `res://` path and there is no relative form — so
## an unprefixed name is one another game can silently overwrite. `entity.tscn`,
## `prop.tscn` and `vehicle.tscn` predate that rule and are the reason it exists: the lobby
## added a `prop.tscn` and collided with this project's on the first vendored build.
