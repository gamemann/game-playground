## [b]This game already had a rock-the-vote and it was `DotMapTimeLimit`'s, which is half
## of one.[/b] That half is real — it counts a fraction of the players and fires — and what
## it cannot do is offer a ballot, take nominations, break a tie, respect a cooldown, or
## give somebody the option to extend. dot-vote is fifty-five settings over exactly those,
## and the ad-hoc version is now the *time limit* under it rather than the vote itself.
##
## [b]The source is dot-map's catalogue, not dot-server's games.[/b] game-hungario votes
## over games because its modes are games; this one votes over **maps**, and
## `DotVoteMapSource` applies through the [DotMapSession] this game already drives. One
## engine, two sources, and neither this file nor that one names the other — which is the
## whole reason `DotVoteSource` exists.

## [/codeblock]

## vote and its extend option, which is what an owner usually wants to change:
##
## [codeblock]
## {
##     "end_vote": true,          "vote_lead_sec": 120,
##     "include_extend": true,    "extend_seconds": 900,    "max_extends": 4
## }
## [/codeblock]
##
## [code]DOT_VOTE_EXTEND_SECONDS=1200[/code] or [code]--vote-include-extend=false[/code]
## do the same for one run. A result that does not validate is refused whole and the
## defaults stand, with the reason in the log.
