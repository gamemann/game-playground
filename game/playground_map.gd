## Base class for the playground's built-in maps.
##
## [b]A map carries its own zones here, and a delivered map would ship a JSON
## file.[/b] Both routes are real and dot-map supports both: `DotMapDef.zones_path`
## points at a file, and a map that ships inside the game's own build can instead
## answer [method timer_zones] directly. This project uses the second for its own
## maps and keeps a written-out copy of one of them in `maps/` — with a check in the
## headless suite that the two agree, because a zone file that has drifted from the
## geometry it was drawn against is a leaderboard nobody can compare.
##
## Subclasses override [method _build] and [method timer_zones].

# --- What the movement can do ----------------------------------------------
#
# [b]The three numbers every jump on every built-in map is sized against, copied from
# `PlaygroundPlayer._tunables` deliberately,[/b] as constants so a map's layout can be
# written with them. The arithmetic over them is not copied: [method jump_reach] asks
# `PlaygroundPlayer.movement_tunables()`, a static builder, so a map with no player in
# the tree still asks the movement itself. `headless_playground` asserts these three
# against the tunables the server actually applies.
#
# They lived in `pg_lobby` until a second map needed them. Here rather than a second
# copy in `pg_bhop_intro`, because two copies of one number is this tree's most
# repeated bug and the base class is the one place every built-in map already reads.

## Ground speed, m/s. `DotFpsTunables.max_speed`.
const MOVE_SPEED := 7.0

## Metres. `DotFpsTunables.jump_height`. NOT the addon's default, which is 1.1.
const JUMP_HEIGHT := 1.15

## m/s². `DotFpsTunables.gravity`. Not Godot's project default, which is 9.8.
const MOVE_GRAVITY := 20.0


## The clear air a player running at [constant MOVE_SPEED] crosses in one jump, landing
## [param rise] metres higher than they left. 0.0 for a rise the jump cannot reach.
##
## [b]Asked of the movement, not worked out here.[/b] This was a copy of the arithmetic
## until dot-player-controller answered it on `DotFpsTunables.jump_reach`; now it asks
## the tunables every player here is built with (`PlaygroundPlayer.movement_tunables`,
## static, so a map with no player in the tree can ask). The landing height is still
## the point: 4.75 m flat, 4.16 m onto a 0.5 m step.

## [b]Box to box, not centre to centre minus a width.[/b] The second is what
## `pg_lobby`'s tower was checked with, and it is a different number in every
## direction: two axis-aligned squares 45 degrees apart round a circle are closer at
## their corners than their centres say, and a square pad beside a square platform
## diagonally off its corner is 0.2 m of air that a centre distance calls 3.8.
##
## A route on a built-in map is a list of these boxes, in the order a player lands on
## them — see `PgLobby.tower_route` — so the gap and the rise of every jump are read off
## the geometry rather than kept beside it as a table that can drift.

## [code]Playground._on_seated[/code] cancels a run when a player gets into a vehicle,
## because a foot course driven round in a buggy is not a time anybody can compare with
## one that was jumped — and dot-timer has no idea a vehicle exists, so nothing below
## this can tell the difference.
##
## A circuit inverts that: the car is the point, and getting OUT of it mid-lap is the
## thing that should end the run. A map says which of its tracks are which, because the
## map is the only thing that knows. See `pg_lobby`'s bonus 3.
