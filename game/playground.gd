## [b]This is the only place every addon in the movement half of the family runs
## together[/b] — dot-player-controller, dot-timer, dot-map, dot-props and
## dot-leaderboard, over dot-core — and, by the family's own repeated lesson, the
## seams between them are where the bugs are. Each addon's own suite runs it with the
## others absent; `examples/headless_playground.tscn` is the only thing that runs the
## joins.

## the player's own copy of both would be non-authoritative.
