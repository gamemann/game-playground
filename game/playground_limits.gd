## How many of each kind of thing one player may have, and who gets more.
##
## [b]Separate counts per kind, which is what a sandbox actually needs.[/b] One prop budget
## treats sixty crates and sixty NPCs as the same sixty, and they are not: the crates are
## somebody building, the NPCs are somebody making the server unplayable. The sandboxes
## this game is shaped like each kept a limit per kind — props, NPCs, entities, vehicles,
## balloons, weapons, ropes and welds — and an operator turns them independently.
##
## [b]Roles, by name.[/b] An operator writes
##
## [codeblock]
## pg_limit_roles "admin: npcs=40 props=600; vip: props=300 balloons=60"
## [/codeblock]
##
## and a player gets the most generous value among the roles they hold — their dot-server
## admin groups by name, plus `admin` for anybody with an admin flag and `root` for the
## root flag. A value of 0 is "no limit". The defaults are the `pg_max_<group>` cvars.
##
## dot-props counts and refuses ([member DotPropLimits.group_limits],
## [member DotPropSpawner.limit_resolver]); this file only answers "how many for this
## player". Constraints are not props, so the tool gun asks [method limit_for] itself.
