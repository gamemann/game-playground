## [b]This class is the bridge, and the bridges are where the bugs are.[/b] Every
## addon here is complete and tested on its own; what has never run is the joins
## between them, and the family's own history says that is where everything is found.
## Concretely, this file is the only place that knows:
##
## - the timer must be ticked from the **movement** loop, once per simulated tick,
##   with the position the movement just produced — not from `_process`, and not
##   before the move;
## - a style has two halves that must be applied together
##   ([code]DotFpsStyle[/code] and [code]DotTimerStyle[/code]);
## - a zone's effects are the game's to apply, because the timer will not touch a
##   player;
## - a prespeed limit runs *inside* the simulation, so it is applied between the
##   move and the next tick rather than when a signal happens to arrive.
