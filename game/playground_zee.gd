## zee-dot-weapons in the sandbox: twenty-seven real weapons beside the three toys.
##
## [b]A second kind of weapon, not a SWEP with a gun painted on.[/b] `PlaygroundWeapon` is a
## prop tool: two edge-triggered buttons and a float delta, run where the input is. A zee
## weapon is dot-weapon's: a held-button command per integer tick, its own cadence, reload
## and ammunition, and an outcome full of shots that the game resolves. Wrapping one in the
## other would throw away the cadence and run the shot on the client, which is a client
## deciding what it hit. So the menu, the shop and the loadout see one list of
## [PlaygroundWeaponDef]s, and `meta.zee` says which machinery is behind an entry.
##
## [b]Named by class, not by path, and that is not the rule broken.[/b] The path rule is for
## this game's OWN scripts, whose `class_name`s a mounted pack never registers. `Zee*` and
## `DotWeapon*` are addons compiled into the host — the client shell carries both — so they
## are registered wherever this runs. mg-smash-copter names them the same way.
##
## [b]A shot hurts only when the arena is on.[/b] A sandbox is not a deathmatch, and a
## weapon pack is not a reason to make it one: with `pg_arena 0` a shot shoves the prop it
## hits — something to do with a gun in a sandbox — and touches nobody. The arena's
## dot-combat resolves the same shot when it is on, through [member PlaygroundNetBridge.shot_fn].
