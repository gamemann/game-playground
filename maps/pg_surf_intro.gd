## `pg_surf_intro` — two routes. A valley between two ramps, and a face you fall down.
##
## [b]The main run is the shape every surf map is made of, reduced to its
## minimum[/b]: two slabs tilted past `max_slope_angle` so a player on one is never
## grounded, meeting along a centre line that is exactly the seam a naive
## collide-and-slide stops a player dead in.
##
## [b]What it is NOT is a route whose speed comes from those ramps.[/b] They are
## level along their length — every metre of descent on the main run comes from the
## stepped floor between them — so a player can ride the whole map without the ramps
## having given them anything. Measured on 2026-09-18 by instrumenting the suite's
## own bot: a scripted strafer covers 10.7 m of the 220 m route and crosses none of
## its splits, while the two checks over it ("most of the descent is spent not
## grounded", "the player reaches surf speed") both pass — of a player who is
## falling. That is the whole reason [b]the plunge[/b] below exists, and the reason
## the two checks now have a printed distance beside them.

# --- Bonus 1: the plunge ---------------------------------------------------
#
# The map's second route, and the one where the speed comes from the RAMP rather
# than from the fall. The main run's two ramps are level along their length — they
# are walls that fall toward a valley, and every metre of descent on that route
# comes from the stepped floor between them. So a player can ride the whole map
# without the ramps ever having given them anything, and the route never asks the
# question surf is actually about: hold a line on a face you cannot stand on while
# gravity does the work.
#
# The plunge asks it. One face, pitched past `max_slope_angle` so the player is
# never grounded on it, descending along the run so that gravity accelerates them
# ALONG the route instead of straight down. The difficulty is staying on a
# fourteen-metre-wide face while going faster every tick, and falling off it is
# what the track's own respawn volume is for.
#
# It is deliberately STRAIGHT, and that is a design decision rather than a lack of
# ambition — the same one `game-g2gfast`'s `the needle` was built on. A scripted
# bot cannot air-strafe, so a route that needs turning is a route no suite can run
# end to end, and an unrun route is one nobody finds the holes in. See
# `[bonus-run-2]` in the nightly to-do list: this family had driven exactly two
# bonus routes start to finish, and both were straight for this reason.
#
# [b]Half of that was wrong, and it is worth saying which half.[/b] A bot cannot
# air-strafe, so a route that needs speed CARRIED round a turn is still out of reach.
# A route that only needs the player to face somewhere new before the next jump is not:
# `pg_lobby`'s tower and `pg_bhop_intro`'s switchback are both driven end to end by a
# bot that steers by yaw every tick. A surf route turns by riding a bank, which is the
# first kind, so this one stays straight.
