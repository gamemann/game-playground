This is a game to demonstrate the capabilities of the [**Dot collection**](https://moddingcommunity.com/co/4-dot-assets) built on-top of [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) and [TMC's gaming platform](https://moddingcommunity.com/play). In this 3D game, players are allowed to do whatever they want. It is intended to be a sandbox game. Players may hold the **Q** button in-game to bring up a menu to spawn props, NPCs, and weapons. You may also interact with props in the world using the physics and gravity guns. This is inspired by classic Sandbox games like Garry's Mod!

*Play on my test server [here](https://moddingcommunity.com/playground/s/pg01/play)!*

**This project and the assets under it are COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE**. You are free to use, modify, and distribute them under the terms of the MIT license. The only thing not open source is the back-end web infrastructure. So if you opt into using your own authentication backend instead of integrating with TMC, you will need to build and integrate your own back-end infrastructure.

## From Maintainer & WARNING
This project, along with every asset it is built on, was built initially with **Claude Code** and will continue to be maintained and extended using it. This is because I (`gamemann`) cannot build the entire TMC platform alone (I wish I could lol).

**Please treat this as partially tested.** It has its own headless test suite and that suite passes, but very little of this has been in front of real players yet. Expect rough edges, and please report anything you run into.

I intend on reviewing code, testing, and editing documentation regularly. If you're interested in helping out, please let me know!

## How it plays
Hold **Q** to open the spawn menu. Clicking something in it spawns it, and the menu stays open so you can keep building. There are four tabs, and `/` searches:

| Tab | |
| --- | --- |
| **Props** | Planks, panels, beams and pillars to build with; crates and barrels; balls from a beach ball to a boulder; and buttons, levers and doors |
| **Entities** | NPCs. One wanders, one chases you, one hops, one spins, a hunter, and soldiers and rebels that carry weapons. Soldiers fight players and rebels; rebels fight soldiers and follow you |
| **Weapons** | A launcher that fires props, a remover, an impulse gun, and the twenty-seven weapons of [zee-dot-weapons](https://github.com/gamemann/zee-dot-weapons). Right click a weapon in the menu to drop it on the ground |
| **Tools** | The tool gun: inflate, colour, remove, weld, no-collide, rope, balloon, physical properties, wire, and giving an NPC a weapon |

Some of what you can do:

- **Pick props up** with the physics gun and freeze them in place, or punt them with the gravity gun. You can pick other players up too (`pg_pickup`).
- **Ride props.** Stand on a moving prop and it carries you.
- **Wire things up.** Use the tool gun's wire mode to connect a button or lever to a door, then press it with **F**.
- **Save what you built** with `pg_save <name>` and load it again later with `pg_load <name>`.
- **Break things** when the server has `pg_destruction 1`: crates and planks break apart and barrels explode.
- **Creative mode.** Type `!creative` and nobody can touch you or your props, and you can't hurt anybody.
- **Fight.** `pg_arena 1` turns on damage between players, and `pg_waves` sends waves of armed NPCs.

There are four maps:

- **pg_lobby** is the sandbox: a 200-metre plate to build on. Its main track has no timer, so building is never timed. In one corner there is a jump course (bonus 1), a spiral tower (bonus 2) and a driving circuit round the plate (bonus 3). Press **T** to switch to one.
- **pg_surf_intro** is two surf ramps meeting in a valley, with a steep slide and a slalom of blocks as bonuses.
- **pg_bhop_intro** is bunny-hop blocks with widening gaps, plus six bonus courses.
- **pg_generated** is built from a seed each time it loads: rooms joined by corridors, with props scattered through them. Start with `--pg-map-seed=<n>` to pick the seed, so you can share a layout.

## Getting started
You need [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/download). The game is built from many Dot addons, each in its own repository, so the easiest way to get everything is [dot-bootstrap](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-bootstrap). It clones every project and links the addons into each one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-bootstrap.git
cd dot-bootstrap
./bootstrap.sh
cd projects/game-playground
./game.sh
```

On Windows, run `bootstrap.ps1` instead and open the project in Godot.

`game.sh` does everything else:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `./game.sh` | Play offline, in a window |
| `./game.sh online` | Start a local server and the browser client, and print the link to open |
| `./game.sh online down` | Stop them |
| `./game.sh server` | Start a local dedicated server only |
| `./game.sh test` | Check every script and run every test suite |
| `./game.sh shot` | Save a screenshot to `screenshots/` |
| `./game.sh help` | All of the options |

`online` and `server` use [dot-server-deploy](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-server-deploy), which bootstrap clones next to this one. Run its `./setup.sh` once first.

## Running a server
Settings are cvars. Set them in the server's config, on the command line, or live from the console. `cvarlist pg_` lists them all.

```
pg_map_seconds 1800          // how long a map runs before the vote (0 = forever)
pg_creative 1                // players may turn on creative mode
pg_prop_surf 1               // moving props carry the players standing on them
pg_destruction 0             // props can break, and barrels explode
pg_pickup 1                  // the physics gun can pick players up
pg_pickup_immune "admin"     // roles nobody may pick up
pg_pickup_override "root"    // roles that may pick anybody up
```

### Limits
Each player has a limit for each kind of thing: `pg_max_props`, `pg_max_npcs`, `pg_max_entities`, `pg_max_vehicles`, `pg_max_balloons`, `pg_max_weapons` and `pg_max_constraints` (welds, ropes and no-collides). 0 is no limit. A role (an admin group, or `admin` / `root`) can get more:

```
pg_max_npcs 10
pg_limit_roles "admin: npcs=40 props=600; vip: props=300 balloons=60"
pg_limits u3                 // what player u3 is using against their limits
```

### Console commands

| Command | |
| --- | --- |
| `pg_status` | What the server is doing |
| `pg_map <id>`, `pg_nextmap`, `pg_rtv` | Change the map, see what is next, rock the vote |
| `pg_arena [0\|1]` | Damage between players on or off |
| `pg_waves` | Waves of armed NPCs |
| `pg_props_clear` | Remove every prop |
| `pg_save <name>`, `pg_load <name>`, `pg_builds`, `pg_build_delete <name>` | Saved builds |
| `pg_shop [0\|1]` | Prices for spawning, paid from a bag |
| `pg_give <player> <prop> [count]`, `pg_inv <player>` | Put things in a player's bag, or read it |
| `pg_zone`, `pg_zone_mark`, `pg_zone_save` | Draw timer zones (see below) |

### Drawing timer zones
Any map can get a timed course. Stand in the map and draw the zones from the console:

```
pg_zone start          // the kind of zone to draw
pg_zone_mark           // stand on one corner
pg_zone_mark           // then the other
pg_zone_save           // write them to disk
```

### Admin commands
These come from [dot-moderation](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-moderation): `!noclip`, `!freeze`, `!slay`, `!bring` and the rest. `blind <player>` blacks out that player's screen, and `beacon <player>` puts a ring and a ping on them for everybody to see.

### The map vote
The vote for the next map is [dot-vote](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-vote). The defaults are in `game/playground_vote.gd`. To change them, put a file at `user://cfg/playground_vote.json` (or use `DOT_VOTE_*` environment variables, or `--vote-*` arguments):

```json
{ "end_vote": true, "vote_lead_sec": 120, "include_extend": true, "extend_seconds": 900, "max_extends": 4 }
```

`end_vote: false` turns the end-of-map vote off, and `include_extend: false` takes "extend" off the ballot. dot-vote's README lists every setting.

### The bag and the shop
With `pg_shop 1`, spawning costs money. A player's bag is a 10 x 6 grid with a 400 kg limit: buying puts things in it, and spawning something you carry is free. There is no screen for the bag yet.

## Testing

```bash
./game.sh test                         # every script parses, then every suite runs
./game.sh test headless_playground     # one suite
```

| Suite | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `headless_playground` | The whole game: props, NPCs, weapons, every tool, limits, the menu, the courses and map changes |
| `headless_net` | A server and a client in one process, over the network code |
| `headless_presentation` | What a client draws and plays |
| `headless_stack` | The whole stack of addons together |
| `dedicated` | A real server: boots, loads the game, runs its commands |

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) has the design decisions and the reasoning behind them.

The weapons are from [zee-dot-weapons](https://github.com/gamemann/zee-dot-weapons), which credits its own art. The props and the menu icons are drawn from their definitions, so the game ships no art of its own.
