## [b]This is the only thing in the family that runs the joins between these five
## addons.[/b] Each has its own suite and each passes with the others absent, and the
## family's own history says that proves very little: every bug that has cost a day
## here was in a seam — a bridge reconciling on top of another bridge, a client
## message keyed on the wrong id, a value computed and consumed by nothing. So this
## test is about the joins, not about the parts:
##
## - the timer is ticked from the movement loop, with the position the move produced;
## - a style change moves both halves together;
## - a zone's effect reaches the player through the game and not through the timer;
## - a record is filed, scored, and reaches the leaderboard;
## - a map change tears down runs, props and geometry in an order that survives;
## - a prop can be spawned, held, and freed without leaking a node.
##
## The bot's input is a scripted [DotFpsCommand] rather than a device, which is the
## whole reason [DotFpsSampler] is a separate object.

## Drives a bot along a route of standable boxes, steering by yaw every tick.
##
## [b]This is what the spiral needed, and it is not air-strafing.[/b] The written reason
## bonus 2 had no drive was that "a spiral is finished by air-strafing round a corner",
## and that was a description of the BOT, not of the course: every bot here held one yaw
## for its whole run, so a course that turned was one it could only ever fall off. A
## course whose gaps are half a reach needs no carried speed at all — it needs a player
## who faces the next platform before jumping at it, and a scripted bot can do that
## exactly, reading the route off the map.
##
## Three rules, and each is a thing a player does:
##
## - **Face the next box's centre, every tick, in the air too.** On the ground that
##   turns the run; in the air it is a brake as much as a steer — `air_accelerate` is
##   100 with a 1 m/s wish cap, so a wish pointed back at a centre the bot has passed
##   takes its speed off within a few ticks, and it lands near the middle rather than
##   off the far side.
## - **Jump on the last grounded tick before the edge**, judged by a point
##   [param look_ahead] metres ahead along the heading leaving the box it stands on.
##   Not jump held: see `_jumping_at` for why that gets a bot nowhere.
## - **What it stands on is decided by where it is**, not by a counter. A bot that falls
##   onto a lower turn of a spiral simply resumes from there, which is how a respawn
##   and a missed landing both come out right without a special case.
##
## [param walks] names the boxes whose next step is WALKED — a ramp up to the next box —
## rather than jumped. Off one of those the bot never jumps, and it counts the ticks it
## spends grounded between the two boxes, which is on the ramp: a drive that finishes
## with none on some ramp got up it some other way.
##
## Returns `{started, finished, splits, reached, ticks, respawns, walked, distance,
## top_speed}`; `reached` is the highest box index stood on, reported so a failure names
## the jump; `walked` maps each of [param walks] to its grounded ramp ticks; `distance` is
## the horizontal ground the bot covered (respawn teleports left out) and `top_speed` its
## fastest horizontal speed, both for `[bot-drive-1]`'s printed pace.

## finished by air-strafing round a corner. Measured, it is not: every gap on the tower
## is 2.04 m of air against a 4.02 m climbing reach, so nobody has to carry any speed
## round anything — they have to FACE the next platform before jumping at it, which is
## a thing a scripted bot can do exactly and which no bot in this family had ever been
## written to do. Every one held a single yaw for its whole run. See [method _drive_route].
##
## What this still proves before it drives, and both are invisible to every count: the
## spawn faces the course, and it is outside the pillar.

# --- The narrows -----------------------------------------------------------

## `pg_bhop_intro`'s bonus route, driven start to finish.
##
## [b]This is the first bonus track in this family that anything has ever run.[/b]
## Every other bonus here is checked by switching onto it, looking at the spawn and
## switching back — which is why they went for as long as they did with no respawn
## zone on them at all. A route nothing has completed is a route nobody knows is
## completable.
##
## [b]The driver is the interesting part, and it is not "hold forward and jump".[/b]
## That is what the rest of this suite does and it produces a player travelling at
## **one** metre a second: with `auto_hop` on and jump held, the player leaves the
## ground on the tick it lands, so `accelerate` (7 m/s on the ground) never gets a
## tick to work in, and air acceleration cannot make up the difference because
## `max_air_wish_speed` is 1.0 — that cap is the whole reason air-strafing is a skill
## rather than a button. A real player gains speed by turning into the strafe; a bot
## that holds one direction cannot, and it bleeds back to the cap.
##
## So this bot jumps **at the gaps** instead of continuously, which keeps it on the
## ground long enough to hold 7 m/s and is why the narrows has a constant
## [constant PgBhopIntro.BONUS_GAP]: 3.5 m is 0.5 s of flight at that speed against
## the 0.68 s a 1.15 m jump buys, so the route is clearable without ever gaining any.
## The main run deliberately is not — its last gap is 7 m and only a player who has
## been strafing can cross it, which is what that route is for.

# --- The client -------------------------------------------------------------

## A real `PlaygroundClient` boots and ends up with a player, a camera and a menu.
##
## [b]The one path in this project no other test touches, and it broke silently.[/b]
## Everything above drives `Playground` directly, because that is the half that runs
## headless — so the client's own boot sequence was covered by nothing, and when it
## started waiting for a signal that had already been emitted it simply stopped
## halfway through `_ready`. No error, no failed load, nothing in the log: a black
## screen with a `Playground` ticking behind it. Only a screenshot showed it.
##
## `change_map` completes without ever suspending when the map is a scene already in
## the build, which is every map here — so this test exercises exactly the case that
## broke. It would deadlock, not fail, without `booted` being checked before the
## await; the suite's own `timeout` is what turns that into a red run.
# --- Vehicles --------------------------------------------------------------

## A car spawned from the prop catalogue, driven, ridden in and got out of.
##
## [b]The whole point of this test is that a vehicle here is BOTH things at once.[/b]
## dot-vehicle's own 122 checks drive real bodies through real physics, and every one of
## them spawns through [method DotVehicleSpawner.spawn] into a world with nothing else in
## it. What has never run anywhere is a vehicle that is also a [DotPropInstance] — on a
## prop budget, on an undo stack, adopted rather than spawned, with its wheels built by
## the game after the body was created by somebody else.

## is a straight line, so the skill in it is timing rather than turning, and a bot
## holding forward that jumps at each leading edge is doing what a player does.
##
## The gaps are read off [PgLobby]'s own arithmetic rather than copied here, for the
## reason every map in this family says: a second description of where a platform is, is
## a second thing that can disagree with the geometry.

## A spawn's yaw, read after the simulation has run rather than before it.
##
## [b]Every spawn-yaw check in this file used to read the yaw on the tick it was set,
## and that is the only tick it was ever true.[/b] `PlaygroundPlayer.teleport` wrote
## `controller.state.yaw` directly, and a command carries absolute view angles — so the
## next tick set it back to whatever the command said. A client's sampler had never been
## told and still faced where the mouse last left it; a bot with no command got the
## controller's starved-tick substitute, a fresh command facing yaw 0. Both are asked
## here, and both failed before the fix: this section's own "facing the first block"
## read `yaw 0.0, the spawn says 90.0` once the bot had been standing on a map for a
## while, and passed on a freshly-added one only because its controller had not started
## ticking yet.
# --- The cascade ------------------------------------------------------------

## `pg_surf_intro`'s bonus 2, driven start to finish.

## whose reach is longer than a flat one, and the first time `_drive_route` lands from a
## fall. Every block is offset to the other side of the line, so every jump but the pad's
## and the finish's is a diagonal the bot has to face before taking.
