## Every one of them replicates players and nothing else. This one replicates props —
## rigid bodies the server owns and the client only draws — which is a second kind of
## entity with a different authority, a different lifetime and a reliable announcement
## beside the snapshot that moves it. Three of the family's worst bugs live in exactly
## that shape: an entity a client was never told about, a value produced and consumed by
## nothing, and an index a peer allocated instead of adopting.
##
## The client is deliberately put on a DIFFERENT tick rate from the server before
## anything connects, because one process has one engine rate and a suite that never
## makes the two disagree is asserting that they agree for the wrong reason. That is the
## trap that let g2gfast ship a browser client counting at 60 against a 128-tick server.

##
## - per tick, the gap between the drawn mirror and the server's car (metres, degrees),

## - how long the mirror takes to land on the car once the car has stopped.
